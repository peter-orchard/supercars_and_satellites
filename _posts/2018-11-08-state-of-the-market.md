title: State of the Market
---

From the heady heights of January's crazy bubble peak, the market fell rapidly.
Over the year, the rate of decline slowed down, and since mid August the market
has been moving sideways. So, is this the bottom? Is it a good time to be
moving your fiat into crypto? Perhaps. If this is indeed the new bottom, then
it would be good to get in now. But that is not certain; it could be that the
downtrend resumes for another few months. A trend is yet to be established one
way or the other. If the market does move upwards, I expect it to be a slow
uptrend; a quick bounce upward seems unlikely.

For an investor looking to buy crypto for a long-term hold, it probably doesn't
matter too much. If you're planning to do that, you probably think, like me,
that the market value is going to be much higher than it is now at some future
point, regardless of what dips occur in between. The cautious approach would be
to wait a month or two to see what kind of trend develops. A more adventurous
approach would be to buy in now, hoping that this is the bottom. Of course,
one is not limited to do one or the other: a mixture of both is possible or,
of course, an entirely different strategy.

Personally, if I had some spare fiat to invest, I'd be taking the cautious
approach: I'd be waiting to see a little sustained upward motion before I
bought in.
