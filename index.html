  Oh hai! I made a website.
</p>

<p>
  Don't know much about crypto?<br>
  Confused by the title of this website?<br>
  Try the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/static_pages/intro_to_crypto">
    intro to crypto</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  This site can be read in the order of the links in the left panel.
  I shall add to the Blog section when I want to write about transient
  developments, eg the current market conditions. I'll also try to use the blog
  to record changes to the static content. (So if you've read through the site
  and something changes, you should be able to find new stuff from the blog.)
