title: About
---

This site is intended to contain:
1. A brief, mostly non-technical, introduction to cryptocurrency and
   blockchain;
2. Some general thoughts on investing in the crypto market;
3. My opinions and analyses of particular coins, market sectors, and so on.

I write it for:
1. Myself - to collect and organise my ideas;
2. Dionne, Kat, and Chris - who are interested in investing some money;
3. Anyone else who happens across this website.
