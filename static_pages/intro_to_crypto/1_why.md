title: Why Crypto?
---

Why is there so much interest around blockchain and cryptocurrency? Sure, many
people got into it after realising there is money to be made - but what is it
about the underlying technology that makes people think these things will
attain great value in the future?

I think the following are important properties of blockchains. (Not all apply to all blockchains, but there are blockchains with these properties.)
* [Decentralisation](decentralisation).
  No central authority controls the network.
* Security. Blockchain provides guarantees that your money cannot be stolen,
  in the sense that the network cannot be hacked. (Of course, there are many
  other ways in which you can be separated from your currency.)
* Immutability. Once it's on the blockchain, it never leaves. The chain is an
  unalterable record of everything that ever happened on the network.
* Turing-completeness. In layman's terms, platforms like Ethereum are
  general-purpose, decentralised, computers - so any computer program could be
  run on Ethereum. (There are resource limits; in practice, such programs need
  to finish quickly and not use too much memory.)

But what are the benefits of these technical properties?
* There is no longer a need to trust a central authority. For example, your
  fiat money probably resides mostly with a bank. This can be problematic:
  - If the bank decides to prevent you accessing your account, there's not much
    you can do about it - not quickly, anyway.
  - There are often opaque costs and delays, especially for cross-border
    money transfers.
  - Central point of failure, eg if your bank website goes down, you can't use
    internet banking until it comes back up.
  With bitcoin, you retain control of your own money and can send it anywhere
  in the world, instantly and with low cost, without requiring permission from
  anyone.
* More generally, blockchains promise to remove the middleman in many
  industries. Middlemen often exist because people who wish to trade have no
  way of trusting each other. For example, if Alice wants to place a bet and
  Bob wants to take that bet, but Alice and Bob just met on an internet forum,
  it would be imprudent to make that bet since neither can guarantee that the
  other will fulfil their obligations, ie pay up if they lose. So we have
  exchanges such as Betfair, who business consists partly of establishing
  relationships with each party and enforcing their obligations. Alice and Bob
  remove the need to trust each other and replace it with a trust in Betfair -
  which they feel more comfortable with because this is an established company
  with a track record, legal obligations, etc. However, Betfair take their cut;
  Alice and Bob both pay them for this service of establishing trust.
  One of the promises of blockchain tech is to replace Betfair with a fully
  automated, trustless system: rather than trust Betfair, Alice and Bob would
  trust the blockchain. This removes Betfair from the transaction, along with
  their fee. The only fee remaining would be blockchain transaction costs,
  which ought to be far lower than a company like Betfair charges (which makes
  sense because Betfair have to pay their employees, while a blockchain costs
  much less to run). Any industry where middlemen operate may be disrupted in
  this way, making it more efficient, and cheaper to use - and there are many
  such industries, eg gambling, property, legal, insurance, supply chain,
  loans, cloud computing infrastructure, advertising, identity verification,
  social networking, energy, etc.
* Blockchains are distributed across computers running around the world, so it
  is hard for any one jurisdiction to censor or ban them (if governance is well
  decentralised). A good blockchain can have global reach and censorship
  resistance - therefore open to everyone and free from location-based
  discrimination.
* As well as making existing industries more efficient, there is potential for
  new applications that weren't possible before. For example, computer games
  these days often take place in permanent environments, and players play
  for multiple years. In that time, they gather in-game items, some of which
  are rare and coveted by many players, and therefore valuable. Currently, the
  game developer stores those items for the player (acting something like a
  middleman). The player may get to trade the items within the game if the
  developer implements a trading system, but trading outside the game is not
  possible. Blockchains have the potential to tokenise those items, and the
  player would then be able to trade them as any other token, ie trade them
  outside the game, and trade them for fiat currency.
