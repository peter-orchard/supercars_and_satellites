* **Database**: software/algorithm for storing data.

  computer. A distributed database stores its data across multiple machines.
* **Network**: a set of computers.
* **Node**: one computer in a network.

  specifies transfers of BTC between accounts.)

* **Genesis block**: the first block in a blockchain.
* **Altcoin/alt** - any coin that isn't Bitcoin.
* **Token**: a currency built on another blockchain. Often people say "coin"
  loosely when they mean "token". Many cryptocurrencies are built on top of
  Ethereum, so are technically tokens. Often, the difference doesn't matter.
* **ICO**: Initial Coin Offering - when someone creates a new coin/token and
  sells it to investors before launch, typically to raise money for the
  start-up company behind the project. Compare with IPO for traditional stock
  offerings.

  eg "OMG, Stellar is go moon, soon it raining lambos!!!111!!"
* **Whale** - big-money investors,
  eg "Price is down, must be the whales manipulating the market again."
* **HODL** - misspelling of "hold" on a very old forum post, now adopted by the
  community and used intentionally,
  eg "Don't panic about the price drop, just HODL your stash!!!"
* **Shill** - someone who gets paid to talk up the value of a coin,
  eg "Go away, stop shilling your shitcoin on this forum."
* **FUD** - Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt; often lies to discredit a project and
  bring down the value of the coin, eg "It's just FUD guys, keep on HODL!!!11!"
* **FOMO** - Fear Of Missing Out,
  eg "Trump shilled Ripple on Twitter, now it mooning coz everyone FOMO in!"

Yes, crypto forums are often the intellectual equal of the youtube comment
section.
