title: Decentralisation
---

This word comes up a lot, with good reason: it is a key benefit of crypto.
But it can mean different things, and people rarely specify which one they're
talking about. It's important to ask yourself which one they mean when you hear
this word. It can mean:
* Distributed, ie the database is spread over multiple machines. The benefit of
  this kind of decentralisation is robustness: if a node fails, or gets hacked,
  the database is still intact and alive. Only if many nodes fail together will
  the network go down. Most blockchains have this kind of decentralisation, to
  various extents.
* Consensus is not centralised, ie the power to propose and create new blocks
  is spread over multiple nodes (and therefore multiple groups of people).
  For example, BTC is more decentralised than EOS in this sense of the word.
* The network currency is spread around and owned by many people.
  For example, 19% of all BTC is held by the richest 100 accounts versus
  95% for XLM (Stellar).
* Governance is shared: changes to the blockchain software or protocol require
  the agreement of multiple independent parties. Approaches to governance can
  vary quite a bit. For example, Bitcoin has no notion of governance built into
  the protocol: Bitcoin miners, developers, and users discuss the issues, then
  anyone is free to act independently. If enough miners (nodes) adopt a
  proposal, it becomes the new standard; but some people may continue to run
  older software if the change is back-compatible, or the chain may fork if
  different groups decide to do different things (eg when Bitcoin Cash, BCH,
  was created last year). EOS is governed by its 20 masternodes, with voting
  rights going to coin holders. Ripple governance is fully centralised: a
  single company controls every aspect of the protocol.
* Probably some other senses of the word I can't think of right now.
