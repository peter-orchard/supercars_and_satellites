title: Investing and Trading
---

The word *investing* carries with it a sense of seriousness and relative safety, whereas *trading* suggests a high-risk, high-reward, gambling game.
To me, they seem to be the same thing, just with different time scales. If
you're buying and selling on the same day, it's called trading; but if you plan
to sell years after the acquisition, that's investing. The principle is the
same, so I'll use these terms interchangeably.

The Goal
========

Buy low, sell high, right? That's all there is to it... which is correct, in a
sense. Obviously that's far easier said than done, but it's important to keep
this goal in mind as we go into the details. When we examine a cryptocurrency
with a view to investing, we're trying to determine whether its value at some
future point is likely to be greater than its value now.

But *timing* is key: if we invest in a coin now, and it doubles in two years,
that sounds pretty good! But if there were multiple opportunities in the
meantime to invest in fast-turnaround 10-time-profit-making coins, then the
first investment doesn't look so good: your money is tied up and can't be used
for the big winners.

But it's more complicated than that: trading is *risky*. Putting all your money
into the thing you think has the largest expected return is probably a bad
idea, because if that thing tanks, you've lost all your money. The way to
reduce risk is to diversify: spread your money across a range of promising
investments. Note that this applies within markets and across them: we don't
want all our money in a single crypto coin, nor do we want all our money within
the crypto market at all. Cryptocurrency is extremely promising, but is very
early stage. Maybe something will cause the whole industry to crash and burn.
I can't think what that might be, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.

In summary:
* Decide on your own level of acceptable risk, and diversify appropriately
  both within and outwith crypto.
* We're looking to invest in the coins that are most undervalued.

(More technically, and precisely: form an objective function composed of risk
and reward terms, then attempt to maximise its long-term expectation.)

Information and Time Scales
===========================

When you're trading, you're not building anything, so any money you gain is
money lost by someone else. So to be successful, your knowledge or
understanding of the market has to be better than some other people's. What do
you know that other people don't? In general, the more money you want to make,
or the faster you want to make it, the better your information has to be
relative to other people's.

That information may come in various forms - see, for example, the section on
[Approaches To Trading](./1_approaches). In particular, one form it may take is
the recommendation of a friend who seems to know what they're talking about.
This is often how people get into crypto. If this is you, you should realise
that:
1. Even your smart-sounding friend doesn't know the future, and
2. This is the only information advantage you have over everyone else - which
   means you should only be investing for the longest of time scales. If you
   do decide to buy in, you should be doing it with a view to holding those
   initial purchases for a matter of years. Only if you spend many months
   absorbing yourself in the technology and the market should you even consider
   making shorter-term trades.
