title: Approaches To Trading
---

Approaches to trading may be classified into 4 groups:
1. **Fundamental**: We research the infrastructure of the potential investment.
   Is the team good? Do they have the relevant experience? Do they deliver on
   time? Is the product good? Does it have a market? Is there a marketing plan
   in place? Does the team have enough funding? How does the project stack up
   against its competitors? And so on.
2. **Sentiment**: If someone does their fundamental analysis and decides to
   buy, they probably have good things to say about the project. Conversely,
   if they didn't like what they saw and decide to avoid the project or sell
   what they have, they may have bad things to say. So we can look at the
   overall sentiment (expressed on such channels as twitter, reddit, youtube)
   to decide if more people are buying than selling. If more people are buying,
   the idea is that the price is likely to rise. (But beware the shills!)
3. **Technical**: This is about studying charts of prices over time and looking
   for patterns. Opinions on the validity of technical analysis (TA) vary: some
   swear by it, others thinks it's nonsense. The truth is probably somewhere in
   between. There are clear patterns on some charts (eg BTC vs USD on a log
   scale is almost a straight line over multiple years). But TA practitioners
   often see patterns where there are none. However, TA may be self-fulfilling:
   if enough TA folks draw the same pattern and act on it, the price moves the
   way they predicted - but only because of their own actions!
4. **Quantitative**: This is what the "quants" do. It is a bit like TA, but
   mathematically well-founded. Typically, it involves fitting a mathematical
   model to some price data, then using that model to make predictions of
   future price movements.

For the Beginner
================

I'll say a little about each of the above as it concerns the beginner.
Note 1 and 4 in particular.

1. This is the thing to focus on initially. You should have answers for:
   (a) Why do you think the cryptocurrency market cap will increase?
   (b) Why will the price increase for the coins you've chosen to invest in?
2. Beware! There is so much shilling and general mis-information around the
   crypto markets that you're probably better off ignoring any euphoria or
   despair you may come across, unless you immerse yourself in the field for
   long enough that you learn to spot the real from the fake.
3. Also dangerous. Even if you read a lot about TA, it's a good idea to test
   yourself for some months via paper trading. (Paper trading is making pretend
   trades. You record what you would have done and see if you would have made a
   profit.)
4. Unless you work in a mathematical field, this isn't for you.
   **However**, you could use quant trading approaches developed by other
   people. For example, consider rebalancing - a simple, well-known, algorithm.
   The idea here is that you trade on the belief that a group of assets is
   increasing in value over time; there is some relative price variation
   between them; but you don't understand why that variation happens. This is a
   good fit to crypto: it seems likely to me that certain coins (eg many in the
   top 20 by market cap) will rise over time, but there is a lot of relative
   volatility. Indeed, past performance of this algorithm in the crypto market
   looks [particularly good](https://www.shrimpy.io).
