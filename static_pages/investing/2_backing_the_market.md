title: Backing The Market
---

Unless you're a skilled trader, it is hard to make money in a falling market.
For the beginner, the simplest, longest-time-scale, strategy is buy and hold:
you pick your coins and buy them, then sit and wait a few years for the price
to rise. The belief you're trading on here is that the cap of the whole crypto
market will rise in the long term, despite short-term volatility, and the coins
you've chosen will rise in line with the market. Such a belief likely stems
from an intuition that blockchain technology will be useful but is still in its
early stages of development. Indeed, this is my belief, and in this section
I'll say a little of why I believe that.

There is a great deal that could be, and has been, said here. But I'll be
brief. I think that blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionise a multitude of industries. Roughly speaking, blockchain can
"remove the middleman", automating the task of various existing centralised
groups, thus making systems more efficient and reducing costs. For example:
* No need to have a bank store your money: keep it in Bitcoin;
* No need for bookies: make bets directly with other bettors via a blockchain;
* No need for lawyers: enforce contracts directly in computer code.

(This is simplified - none of those professions will go away, but some of their
functions will, and they will be forced to become more efficient.)

Blockchain also opens up the possibility for new kinds of applications.
For example:
* Digital assets: trade in-game items with other players for real money.
* Prediction markets: use the wisdom of the crowd to forecast events.
* Cross-border payments: bitcoin (and others) isn't controlled by any
  particular country, so payments can be made anywhere in the world without
  time restriction, arbitrary bank charges, or know-your-customer (KYC)
  verifications.
* Transparent voting: store votes on a blockchain to ensure votes are counted
  correctly, and that elections are tamper-proof.

There is a lot of excitement around blockchain these days for the above
applications and a great many more. I think what's coming is nothing short of a
new, global, financial ecosystem. Within a couple of decades, I expect the
majority of exchanges of value to be conducted over blockchains. That's a bold
prediction, but whatever happens, something big is happening with this
technology. Despite recent price drops from the peak of the bubble, the pace of
development continues to increase, universities are offering blockchain courses, companies are looking for blockchain skills, and the big-money
institutions appear to be making moves into the market. To me, the future looks
bright for blockchain.
