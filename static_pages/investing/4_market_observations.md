* Long-term trend shows a steady increase in value.
* Highly volatile in the short term, characterised by huge bubbles, quick
  crashes, and long periods of consolidation in between. (Even though one may
  know the prevailing trend, it is very hard to know where the top of a bubble
  is or the bottom of a dip, so trading on those beliefs is risky unless you
  know what you're doing.)
* Bitcoin tends to move more slowly that the alts, ie it is more stable: it
  goes up more slowly during a bull run, but holds value better during a bear
  market. This is true more generally: higher-market-cap coins tend to be more
  stable than the smaller coins. It's fairly obvious: a big buy into a
  low-value coin could represent a large chunk of the whole token supply.
