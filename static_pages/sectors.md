Here, I group cryptocurrencies by "market sector". This grouping is not a standard one, or precise - it is a rough sorting of projects into groups with similar goals, applications, or technologies. I find it useful because sometimes I want to say things about, for example, the potential uses of blockchain in the gambling industry (as opposed to talking about any specific coin within that sector).
