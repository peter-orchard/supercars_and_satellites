Perhaps the most obvious of use of cryptocurrency is... currency! The clue is in the name. To me, this is one of the least interesting applications of blockchain - but it is an important one, and likely to command a lot of
interest and value. Most cryptocurrencies can be used as currency, in the sense
that they have value and may be exchanged easily. The coins listed here are
those for which currency is their only or primary intended purpose.
