title: Bitcoin (BTC)
---

Bitcoin is a PoW coin, so uses a lot of energy: there's an oft-quoted meme that
bitcoin consumes energy at a similar rate to the whole of Denmark. I'm not sure
this is accurate - but let's just say bitcoin consumes a lot of energy. This
would only increase if bitcoin becomes more popular. This cost is passed on to
users via transaction fees, and it will be up to the market to decide if the
benefits are worth the cost.

Another problem is scaling: Bitcoin can only process a few transactions per
second - not nearly enough for a global currency. There are a few proposed
solutions, the most interesting right now being the Lightning Network. This is
a "layer 2" solution, which means that it takes some transactions off chain.
For example, you want to buy coffee with bitcoin, so you open a lightning
network channel with Starbucks and make payments there for a month. At month
end, your account is settled with a single transaction to the blockchain. Layer
2 solutions trade some decentralisation for speed; the idea is that for small
amounts of money, we don't mind trading a little security for speed and ease,
which is reasonable. Lightning Network is operational now, but in its early
stages.

Bitcoin cannot process smart contracts (like Ethereum, Cardano etc can), but a
project called Rootstock is in development to build that on top of bitcoin.

What reason is there to buy Bitcoin?
Unlike many coins, Bitcoin has no inherent use: it has value only because
people believe it does. (Fiat currencies are mostly like this too. When people
lose their belief in that value, you get failed currencies, eg Venezuela.)
However:
1. As the oldest coin, it is the most stable (relative to other cryptos - it is
   not stable at all relative to fiat yet). This means people have reason to
   buy it when they want to ride out a volatile period, or if they live in a
   country with a weak currency and they have no access to other kinds of fiat.
   So it could become the reserve currency of crypto.
2. The relative stability and pervasiveness make it a "gateway to crypto" for
   people coming in from fiat. You typically use your GBP to buy BTC, then buy
   the coins you really wanted with the BTC. I expect this use to reduce over
   time: we're already seeing more pairings on exchange directly from fiat to
   altcoins.

If BTC does cement its place as the crypto reserve currency, it seems likely
many people would hold it for extended periods, giving it a high and stable
price. Whether it does so remains to be seen - will it survive despite the
high costs? Long term, I don't know. But over the next couple of years, it is
hard to see Bitcoin going in the opposite direction to the whole market. So if
you're betting on the success of crypto, Bitcoin seems like the safest of bets.

Summary
=======

Pros
----
* Early mover advantage.
* Huge popularity - most name recognition of any cryptocurrency.
* Proven security over many years.
* Reasonably well decentralised by all definitions.
* Scaling via Lightning Network is beginning to work,
  with other scaling solutions coming too.
* Stable relative to other cryptocurrencies.
* Gateway to crypto - possibly becoming a crypto reserve currency.
* Much infrastructure already built around it.

Cons
----
* Huge energy consumption.
* Still slow and expensive until LN ramps up.
* No smart contracts until Rootstock.
* Likely to be surpassed in technology by newer chains.

Outlook
-------
* Should remain crypto market leader for at least another year, likely more.
* Seems a safe investment for long-term growth.
