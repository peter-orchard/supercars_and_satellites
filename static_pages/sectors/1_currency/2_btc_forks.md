Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Private
------------------------------------------------------------

These are all forks of Bitcoin. (That means the bitcoin chain was copied and
everyone who held BTC now also holds the new coin. Free money!) The forks
typically have minor changes to the Bitcoin protocol, or change it in a single
aspect. These are mostly cash grabs, and I'm surprised they are valued as high
as they are. I expect them to fail as the market matures.
