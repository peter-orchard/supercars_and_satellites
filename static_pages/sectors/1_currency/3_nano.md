title: Nano (NANO)
---

One of the few cryptocurrencies that is not a blockchain, but a DAG (directed
acyclic graph). In theory, DAGs could be more efficient than chains, but
doing that well is a difficult task: even chains are still a new and active area of research. This makes me sceptical that Nano and other DAG coins can fulfil their promises.

However, I don't know a great deal about Nano, so I can't make a clear judgement. I do recall that:
* Nano is aiming to be a currency only, so no smart contracts and such. This
  is good: if you're going for the bleeding edge DAG tech, it's good to keep
  your goals modest (unlike IOTA, for example).
* Charlie Lee (the Litecoin founder) was mostly positive about it, and bought
  some.
* There were concerns raised about potential security issues, IIRC, but I don't
  know the details or the current state of things.

I'd definitely need to do more research before investing in Nano. Since I'm not so interested in currency versus other applications of crypto, it may be some time before I get round to that, if ever. More importantly, I'm not sure I see the space for another pure currency in a market where we already have a juggernaut (BTC) dominating that niche.
