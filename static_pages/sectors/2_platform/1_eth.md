title: Ethereum (ETH)
---

Pros
----
* Early mover for smart contract platform.
* Much infrastructure already built on and around it.
* Huge development community - the largest of any blockchain project.
* Most used cryptocurrency (more than all others combined) last time I checked.
* Well decentralised by all definitions.
* Multiple projects in progress for scaling without sacrificing security or
  decentralisation: Casper (PoS), Raiden, plasma, sharding.
* ETH has intrinsic value: the fee for running smart contracts is paid in ETH.
* If it realises even some of its ambition to become the underlying layer for
  the new global financial system, then a great deal of money will be
  transacting over it, and stakeholders will likely want to own ETH to ensure
  its security (since PoS is secured by the ETH holders).
* Smart, professional figurehead (Vitalik Buterin).

Cons
----
* Smart contracts are written in Solidity.
  - Solidity was invented by Ethereum and is therefore unfamiliar to existing
    (ie non-blockchain) developers. (I feel this isn't too much of a concern:
    writing smart contracts *should* require a new language because the
    requirements are different than coding off-blockchain. Also, competitors
    such as the up-and-coming Cardano are also developing new languages.)
  - Unlike Cardano, formal verification is not part of Ethereum and Solidity.
    Smart contract bugs can be extremely costly, and there is no way to undo
    the effects of bugs without a hard fork.
* Currently PoW (so uses a lot of energy, like Bitcoin). The Casper project
  will move it to PoS, but:
  - There is a risk that Casper is insecure, or has undesirable consequences.
  - Casper is still a long way off. Possible release in 2019, but the target
    date seems to change often. Other projects are developing at a rapid rate
    and may overtake Ethereum.
* Risk of people not caring about decentralisation and moving to cartel-owned
  platforms like EOS that sacrifice community-focussed governance for speed.

Outlook
-------
Ethereum price dropped rapidly this year (as of November 2018), which is
probably the result of many ICOs selling the ETH they gathered during the bear
market. But Ethereum retains a large developer community, and the ecosystem
continues to grow rapidly. There are no insurmountable problems, so its
momentum is likely to keep it prominent for some time to come. The future of
Ethereum looks bright; I consider it a good, safe, long-term buy.
