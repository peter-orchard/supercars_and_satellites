title: Cardano (ADA)
---

There are similarities between Cardano and Ethereum. Indeed, Charles Hoskinson,
the founder of Cardano, was one of the founders of Ethereum. Like Ethereum,
Cardano is aiming to solve the scaling problem without compromising on
security or decentralisation. Cardano's approach is more academic than
Ethereum's: the team are scientists, and they publish peer-reviewed papers
for their key ideas. Given my own scientific training, this appeals to me
greatly.

It also appeals to me because some of the ideas were developed in
Edinburgh, in the building where I did my PhD! The chief scientist on the
project, Aggelos Kiayias, worked up on the 5th floor among those guys who deal
with languages and compilers. As a machine learner, I didn't have much
academic interaction with them. But I do know that the quality of the Edinburgh
Informatics staff is incredibly good, which gives me confidence that Cardano is
being developed by people who know their stuff. Also involved in the project is
Phil Wadler, who I used to play squash with in Edinburgh. He is the inventor
of Haskell - the language in which Cardano is written - and he is somewhat
revered in the tech community for this.

The academic approach means that the algorithms they publish often come with
mathematical results that prove they behave in the intended manner. The Haskell
language, while not popular for typical programming tasks, is well suited for
writing core blockchain code: the functional style makes it easier to run
formal verification methods to prove that the code does what it was designed to
do. Languages like Plutus - for writing general smart contracts - and Marlowe -
for writing financial smart contracts - are designed to make it easier for
programmers to write verified bug-free code. All of this is important, I think,
because bugs in blockchain design, implementation, or the smart contracts on
top of them can lead to huge monetary losses and/or governance headaches. There
are many examples of such occurrences in the crypto world; indeed, Ethereum
itself was forked into two versions - Ethereum and Ethereum Classic - because
the development team disagreed about how to handle a particularly costly bug.
(Ethereum rolled back the blockchain, Ethereum Classic did not.) If a platform
is to be the base layer for a global financial system, we are talking about
vast sums of money transacting over it. I doubt that people are going to trust
such high-value applications to a system without formal guarantees of correct
behaviour.

Pros
----
* Academic approach: peer-reviewed components come with formal guarantees of
  behaviour.
* Formally verified implementation.
* Tools for formal verification of smart contracts in development.
* PoS.
* Scaleable.
* 2 smart contract networks:
  1. KEVM: Ethereum virtual machine emulator, which means any Ethereum smart
           contract can run on Cardano. This is important for kick-starting the
           platform and attracting Ethereum developers.
  2. IELE: New to Cardano. Compared to KEVM, should run faster and offer better
           tool for programmers, but requires learning unfamiliar languages.
* Domain-specific languages in development, eg Marlowe for specifying common
  operations in financial smart contracts.

Cons
----
* Behind Ethereum at present.
  - Smart contract main net release probably mid 2019.
  - Risk that Cardano is too slow to market.
* Risk of insufficient developer support.
* Risk that people don't care about security and decentralisation, such that
  platforms like EOS trading those things for speed will win out.

Outlook
-------
I must acknowledge some bias with Cardano. I want them to succeed because I
like the academic approach, and because part of it comes from Edinburgh.
It is probably my favourite blockchain project. Nevertheless, I think Cardano
has a bright future. They seem to be doing everything right. The risks I list
above seem unlikely to hamper the project's growth, in my intuition. Cardano is
at an earlier stage than Bitcoin and Ethereum, so it must be considered a
riskier buy than those two, but I consider it worth a buy and long-term hold,
even for a newcomer to crypto.
